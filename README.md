# MatchaBlock Game Development with Unity

Welcome to the MatchaBlock game development repository for Unity! This repository contains the source code and project files for the MatchaBlock game based off of [adammyhre's Match-3](https://github.com/adammyhre/Match3). The game itself has been modified to be more complete and act as a base for adding on additional features to improve my Unity skill set.

## Dependencies

To use this repository, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- [DOTween (Free)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676) OR [DOTween Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/dotween-pro-32416?aid=1101lw3sv)
- Unity Input System
- TextMesh Pro

DOTween is used for creating animations and tweening effects in the game, while the Unity Input System provides a more streamlined way of handling user input.
